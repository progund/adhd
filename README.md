# Requirements

## ObjectCache

ADHD can download serialized files from the Android devices. We have
only tested copying serialized files as created by [ObjectCache](https://github.com/progund/java-extra-lectures/tree/master/caching) which is also developed by your not so very humble idiots at [juneday](http://wiki.juneday.se).

# Software that uses ADHD

We, the idiots at [juneday](http://wiki.juneday.se), use ADHD in some of our courses:
* Android: [Android the practical way](http://wiki.juneday.se/mediawiki/index.php/Android_-_the_practical_way)
* Java:  [Programming with Java](http://wiki.juneday.se/mediawiki/index.php/Programming_with_Java) and [More programming with Java](http://wiki.juneday.se/mediawiki/index.php/More_programming_with_Java)
* Misc: [Extra Lectures](http://wiki.juneday.se/mediawiki/index.php/Misc:Extra_lectures)

... all our courses have videos, texts, exercises, solutions and links
to additional reading. We aim, and have come quite a long way, at
providing intructions for teacher using our material. It's available
for free under a free license.
